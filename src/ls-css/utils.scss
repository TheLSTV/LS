/*
    This function increases specificity x times by repeating the selector.

    eg.

    button#{priority(".myClass", 2)} { ... }

    will result in:

    button.myClass.myClass { ... }

    which boosts the specificity to 0,2,1 instead of 0,1,1 if the class was written just once.

    Use this only in edge cases, where a higher selector is breaking a lower selector and there is not a better way.
